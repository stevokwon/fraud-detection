# Fraud Detection

This project implements a supervised machine learning pipeline to detect fraudulent financial transactions. It focuses on binary classification using real-world-inspired data.

## 🧠 Objective
To accurately classify transactions as fraudulent or non-fraudulent based on multiple features using machine learning techniques.

## 📊 Features
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature selection and engineering
- Model training (Random Forest, Logistic Regression, etc.)
- Model evaluation (Confusion Matrix, AUC-ROC)
- Imbalanced data handling (SMOTE/undersampling)

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python (pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebook

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Open the notebook: jupyter notebook fraud-detection.ipynb
